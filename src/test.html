    <p>My first  step towards my passion for travelling. It was 1400 kms trip. All inspirations came from random thoughts and videos and My senior "SUNDAR". It really  made me feel fullfilled life. I have accomplished something at my young age.</p>

    <p>Things I learnt from this trip:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Close the tap while starting. Otherwise it will give doubtful and worrying thoughts :)</li>
        <li>Since you go with helmet, you won't feel the speed of wind & bike.  While you put a break chekcout the speedometer once.</li>
        <li>You dont need to be expert bike rider. But you will become while riding in the highway.</li>
        <li>You enjoy the ride and your destination will come surprisingly</li>
        <li>You may see accidents on the road. But dont get discouraged or afraid. Focus on your Drive.. :)</li>
        <li>You cannot control yourself from riding your bike 110 km/h.</li>
        <li>If you want to check your capable of riding a bike at maximum speed or want check your bikes maximum speed go for a highway ride.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Wear Helmet - not only for safety. It is very helpful for comfortable riding at high speed</li>
        <li>Wear full sleeves -  To save you skin from sunlight/cold weather</li>
        <li>Take a break at every 1 hour / 100 kms</li>
        <li>Drink plenty of water and Eat light food which is easier to digest. </li>
        <li>Take a bath once a day</li>
        <li>Plan your stay  &  travel time very clearly.</li>
        <li>Take  a look at your fuel whil everytime you take a break</li>
    </ul>
